This is the updated version of the LC Meter's Case.

I modified the holes for the screws which originally held the PCB in place. 
Now the screws go from the bottom section to the upper shell of the case holding everything together 
and thus providing a tighter fit. 

I've also modified the Battery Cover to provide better access when the battery needs to be changed. 

If your PCB is 1mm Thick use the STL files in this folder: "LC Meter Updated Case (1mm PCB)"

For PCBs, which are 1.6mm Thick use the STL files in this folder: "LC Meter Updated Case (1.6mm PCB)"

All the other printable parts are unmodified.


The screws which will fit the new geometry are visible in the "UPDATED LC Meter Case.JPG"



I would like to thanks Mike Doty (hackaday) for testing these new STL files and providing valuable feedback.
